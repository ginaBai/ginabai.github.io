- <b>Student 2</b>: 
"<i>Ms. Bai was very patient with all of her students and provided excellent instruction during this course. If there was a topic or question that she did not have an immediate answer for, she promptly researched the answer and followed-up with all students via piazza or another lecture answering the question.</i>"
- <b>Teaching Feedback from Dr. Sarah Heckman </b>(Director of Undergraduate Programs, Department of Computer Science): 
"<i>Overall, Ms. Bai demonstrated expertise in the materials, provided lots of opportunities for engagement in problems, and described the proof concepts well. She has adopted existing course materials and adapted them to her instructional style. She engaged students during the lecture, which is especially challenging in online instruction.</i>" [[View Full Teaching Feedback]](https://ginabai.github.io/files/Teaching/2020_Bai_TeachingFeedback.pdf)
