## I am on the Academic Job Market!

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, where I am advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. My research interests fall into the intersection of software engineering and Computer Science education. In particular, I am intersted in understanding and addressing the barriers and misconceptions that students have during developing and testing software.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, reading, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ginabai_r/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and doing jigsaw puzzles.
