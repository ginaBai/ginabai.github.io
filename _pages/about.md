I am a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University where I am advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. My research interests are in the areas of software engineering education, testing, code search, empirical software engineering.

Please reach out to me at *rbai2 AT ncsu DOT edu* if you would like to collaborate or talk more about my research!
