I'm <b>Rui Bai</b> (sounds like "ray bye"), and I publish research under <b>Gina R. Bai</b>.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, where I am advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. My research interests fall into the intersection of software engineering and computer science education. In particular, I am intersted in understanding and addressing the barriers and misconceptions that students have during software development, with a specific focus on software testing.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, reading, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ginabai_r/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and doing jigsaw puzzles.
