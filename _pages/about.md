<br/>

I'm <b>Rui Bai</b> (sounds like "ray bye"), and you may also know me as "Gina". I publish research under <b>Gina R. Bai</b>. 

I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. In Fall 2024, I teach: 

- CS 1101: Programming and Problem Solving - Java
- CS 2201: Program Design and Data Structures - Java

My research interests fall into the intersection of software engineering and computer science education. In particular, I am interested in understanding and addressing the barriers and misconceptions that students have during software development, with a specific focus on software testing. I am also interested in research areas such as code search and DEI in computing communities.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in June 2022 from North Carolina State University, where I was advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. In 2016, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University where I also minored in Mathematics.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading, photography, and doing jigsaw puzzles (my favorite 1000-piece ones include a pure white, a pure black, and the moon).
