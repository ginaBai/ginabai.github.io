<br/>

I'm <b>Rui Bai</b> (sounds like "ray bye"), and you may also know me as "Gina". I publish research under <b>Gina R. Bai</b>. 

I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. In Fall 2022, I teach:
- CS 1101 - Programming and Problem Solving (Java)

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in June 2022 from North Carolina State University, where I am advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. My research interests fall into the intersection of software engineering and computer science education. In particular, I am intersted in understanding and addressing the barriers and misconceptions that students have during software development, with a specific focus on software testing. I received my BS in Computer Science from Wake Forest University where I also minored in Mathematics.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, reading, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ginabai_r/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and doing jigsaw puzzles.
