## I am on the Academic Job Market!

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, where I am advised by <a href="https://kstolee.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee</a> in the Collaborative Software Engineering Lab. My research interests are in the areas of software engineering education, testing education, and code search.

Please reach out to me at *rbai2 'at' ncsu 'dot' edu* if you would like to collaborate or talk more about my research!
