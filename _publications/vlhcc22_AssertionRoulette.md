## Abstract
Test smells are commonly perceived as having a negative impact on software  maintainability and correctness. Research has shown that <i>Assertion Roulette</i> is the most pervasive smell in industrial and open-source systems. However, some recent studies argue that the impact of <i>Assertion Roulette</i> is not as severe as previously believed, and developers usually consider it  acceptable. 

Yet, test smells can be frustrating, and the presence of the <i>Assertion Roulette</i> test smell may still have a negative impact on students in an educational setting. To assess the impact, we conducted a controlled empirical study with 42 CS students. Participants came from two populations: CS1 and graduate students, to see what role experience may have in terms of test smell's impact. Participants were tasked with implementing source code in Java that passes provided JUnit tests. Through analysis of student-authored source code and survey responses, we measured the impact of <i>Assertion Roulette</i> in three ways: first using code quality measures, second using testing behavior measures, and third using sociological measures of persistence intentions and self-assessed CS ability. Our findings show that the impact of <i>Assertion Roulette</i> on students in this study was minimal. Though students with exposure to the test smell began testing significantly later, they performed similarly in terms of programming measures and the short-term measures of self-assessed CS ability showed no effects. Thus, it would seem the <i>Assertion Roulette</i> smell is no longer a smell at all.
